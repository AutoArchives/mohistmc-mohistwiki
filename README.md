Mohist is a Forge server software implementing Bukkit, Spigot and Paper APIs. This project is to make **mods and plugins usable together**. Currently Mohist is available in 3 versions.

## About Mohist
More versions will be available in the future.

- **Mohist 1.17** has been discontinued to start working on **Mohist 1.18.X**.
- **Mohist 1.18.X** is currently **experimental** and **shouldn't be used in production** as the plugin compatibility is very low.
