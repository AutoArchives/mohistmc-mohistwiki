## Fabric Support

### What about Fabric mods with Mohist ?

* Unfortunately, we don't support Fabric and we don't plan to do it.    

The main reason is that we already have **a lot of work** with making an hybrid software with Forge, and making another one with Fabric would be **difficult** and will **cost a lot of time** to developers.
