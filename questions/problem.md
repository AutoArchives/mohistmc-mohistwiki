### I have a problem with Mohist, what can i do ?

> You have **2 ways** to proceed first.

#### First way

The first way is joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mohist) server to ask help about your problem.    
To report a problem to use, **you must give us these things**: 
    - Latest logs: Can be found in `logs` folder.
    - Crash report: If you have any crash report, please give it to us.

You want to report an error ? **Don't take a screenshot of it**, upload it directly on [this hastebin page](https://paste.ubuntu.com).

#### Second way

The second way is to open an issue on our [Github page](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist/issues). When opening an issue, you must be **connected to github**, and you must **follow one of the issue template**, otherwise your issue will be closed immediately.
