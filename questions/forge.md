### What about Forge with Mohist ?

* Mohist is built on top of Forge.    

Mohist uses Forge as server base to implement the Bukkit, Spigot and Paper APIs. Making a Forge hybrid software is our priority and our main goal. If a mod isn't working well, you can report this compatibility problem on our [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist/issues).
