## Check mods and plugins
---

### I have a problem with a mod or a plugin.

> You have **2 ways** to proceed.

---

#### First way

Take **half** of your mod or plugin list, and **delete it** (after creating a backup). Then, you check if you still have any **problem**.
- I still have the bug:
    - Okay, now just keep the mods/plugins you have in your folder, and **repeat** this process **until** you find the problem.
- I don't have the bug anymore:
    - Take the mods/plugins you **previously** deleted, and put them back in the mods/plugins folder, and **delete** the **other half** of the list.

**Repeat** this process **until** you can find the mod or plugin that is causing your problem.

---

#### Second way

Remove all of your mods/plugins **1 per 1**, or **2 per 2**, *or more*, and see which one is causing your problem.
