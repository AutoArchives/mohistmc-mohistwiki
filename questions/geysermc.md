## GeyserMC Support

### What about Geyser with Mohist?

* Geyser can work with Mohist.    
> Remember that **you can't install Forge mods on Minecraft Bedrock**.

Geyser will work if you only use server side mods on your server. This means that if you need mods on the client side, you'll not be able to use Geyser.
