## Bukkit, Spigot and Paper Support
---

### What about these APIs with Mohist ?

* We use all of these APIs in Mohist.    

Bukkit and Spigot are used to add plugins compatibility into Mohist. Almost all plugins which are using these APIs are compatible, but some of them aren't compatible and need to be fixed on Mohist side. But don't worry, you can report a plugin compatibility on our [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist/issues).

Paper is used to improve Mohist's performance and add some useful features. Mohist 1.12.2 contains paper a lot and we are implementing paper patches into Mohist 1.16.5.
