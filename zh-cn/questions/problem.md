#### First way

The first way is to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mohist) server and to ask for help about your problem.    
To report a problem/an issue, **you must give us this information**:    
    - Latest logs: Can be found in `logs` folder.    
    - Crash report: If you have any crash report, please give it to us.

You want to report an error ? **Don't take a screenshot of it**, upload it directly on [this hastebin page](https://haste.mohistmc.com/).

#### Second way

The second way is to open an issue on our [Github page](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist/issues). When opening an issue, you must be **connected to github**, and you must **follow one of the issue templates**, otherwise your issue will be closed immediately.
