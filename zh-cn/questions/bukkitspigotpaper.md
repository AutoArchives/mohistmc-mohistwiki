## Bukkit, Spigot and Paper Support
---

### What about these APIs with Mohist?

* We use all of these APIs in Mohist.    

Bukkit and Spigot are used to add plugin compatibility into Mohist. Almost all plugins which are using these APIs are compatible, but some of them aren't compatible and need to be fixed on Mohist's side. But don't worry, you can report a plugin incompatibility on our [GitHub issue page](https://github.com/MohistMC/Mohist/issues).

Paper is used to improve Mohist's performance and to add some useful features. Mohist 1.12.2 contains big parts of paper and we are implementing paper patches into Mohist 1.16.5 and above.
