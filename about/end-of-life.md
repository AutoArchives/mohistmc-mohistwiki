Mohist End Of Life Versions
---

### What is an "End of Life" version and what does it mean?

An End of Life version (EOL) is a version that already has received a lot of updates and work from people, and which is/gonna be not supported anymore. The versions that are marked as archived on GitHub or End of Life will not receive any updates from the Mohist team, except for very high priority issues or security fixes.
      
      
> Can we still contribute to these versions?    

**Of course** you can! We will not update it anymore, but the community can still update it by making pull requests to the repository.

> What versions are currently EOL?    

Mohist currently has two EOL versions, which are 1.7.10 and now 1.12.2.

## 1.7.10

This version didn't receive many updates, but due to missing time and users, it cannot be updated anymore. Please use Crucible/Uranium/Thermos as an alternative.

## 1.12.2

This version already received lots of work from the Mohist developers and the other contributors and is one of the most used Mohist versions. We are proud to have created it. Unfortunately, due to a lack of time and the evolution of Minecraft versions, we had to stop maintaining it.     
But this version is not lost! It is stable and still properly usable.
