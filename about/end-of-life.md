Mohist End Of Life Versions

### What is an End of Life version and what does it mean?

An End of Life version (EOL) is a version that already have received a lot of updates and work from people, and which is/gonna be not supported anymore. The versions that are marked as archive on GitHub or End of Life will not receive any updates from the Mohist team, except for very high priority issues or security fixes.
      
      
> Can we still contribute to these versions?    

**Of course** you can! We will not update it anymore, but the community can still update it by making pull requests to the repository.

> What is currently EOL?    

Mohist currently have two EOL versions, that are 1.7.10 and now 1.12.2.

## 1.7.10

This version doesn't have received so much update, but today it's not as so popular as before, and now we cannot update it because of missing of time and users for this version.

## 1.12.2

This version already have received a lot of work from the Mohist developers and the contributors, and is one of the most used Mohist versions, and we are proud to have created it. Unfortunately, due to a lack of time and the evolution of Minecraft versions, we had to stop maintaining it.     
But this version is not lost! It is stable and still properly usable.
